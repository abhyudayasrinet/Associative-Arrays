Associative Arrays
-------------------------------------------
An associative array, map, symbol table, or dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of (key, value) pairs, such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection.

1) the addition of pairs to the collection
2) the removal of pairs from the collection
3) the modification of the values of existing pairs
4) the lookup of the value associated with a particular key

Here the associative array has been implementation as a hashtable using the chaining method.
